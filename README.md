# Yii2-eloquent
A drop in Laravels Eloquent and Illuminate/Database implementation for Yii2

## Features: ##
- [x] Working extension (Still need to check Eloquent events and pagination)
- [x] Migrations
- [x] Fixtures
- [ ] Model factories for use with testing instead of Fixtures?
- [ ] Other Laravel test helpers for Eloquent models?
- [ ] Adapter for Yii::$app->db? Cause it's confusing to use it now in IDE with autocompletion
- [ ] Docs
